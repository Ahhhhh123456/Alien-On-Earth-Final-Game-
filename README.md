This is my final game which is an expansion of the Platformer game.


This expansion features everything that I wanted to do in my rubiric (besides the extra credit things).


Note that everything being commited is all at once as I did this by myself.


I've been working on it since last week trying to finish my game as fast as possible as I was worried I would run out of time to complete my ambitions. 


One thing to note is that if the alien falls through the map, you would need to jump back up to fix this issue. I'm not sure what happens but the collision isn't being detected


Another thing to note is that if you walk to the right and get stuck (common in level 1), the solution is to walk back left to fix this issue.


I'm not sure why these issues happen but I'm not sure how to fix them.
